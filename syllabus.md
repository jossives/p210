**Instructor:** Joss Ives (joss@phas.ubc.ca)

**TAs:**	

**Location:** 	Hebb B112

**Schedule:**  	
| | Section 101/L1A | Section 102/L1B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lecture | Mon/Wed 12:30-13:00 | Mon/Wed 15:30-16:00
| Lab | Mon/Wed 13:00-14:50 | Mon/Wed 16:00-17:50 |

Please attend the section you are registered in. The division on the timetable  between the  Lecture and Lab sections is mostly for bookkeeping. See class format, below.

**Pre-reqs:** One of PHYS 102, PHYS 108, PHYS 118, PHYS 158, PHYS 153, SCIE 001.

**Co-reqs:** One of MATH 152, MATH 221, MATH 223

**Office Hours:**	 to be announced

**Textbook:** There is no required textbook. Pre-reading notes will be provided. The internet is awash with relevant resources, though it is not always easy to locate what’s relevant and useful. There is a book available that uses a similar approach and is recommended if you want another source: A Student’s Guide to Python for Physical Modeling. by Kinder and Nelson. There are three versions: “the original”, an “Updated Edition” and the latest “Second Edition.” The newest (2nd edition) is probably the best choice.

**Online Tools:**

- **Cocalc:**  Most of our work will be done on an online computing platform called cocalc. You will need to set up an account at cocalc.com, using an email address. Please see additional note below. We recommend that you pay the Cocalc course fee (US$14). Paying this fee allows your work to run on faster servers and will generally provide a better experience.
- **Canvas:** We will make some use of Canvas for distributing materials, administering some quizzes, course announcements etc.
- **iClickerCloud:** In-class polling.
- **Piazza:** Online discussion forums.

**Your private information and Cocalc:** Cocalc is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site, you are transferred to these servers. UBC cannot guarantee security of your private information on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using personal information. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy if you have concerns. Please feel free to contact us at UBC (LT.hub@ubc.ca) or CoCalc's support team (help@sagemath.com) if you have any questions about your privacy. If for privacy reasons you choose to use a different email address, you will need to tell us what that address is so that your work can be attributed to you.

## Class format: 

* **Skill-building class periods (the first seven weeks):** We will the first seven weeks building up your computation skills in a regular cycle of pre-class activities, in-class group activities and individual lab work. 
* **Mini-projects (the final five weeks):** We will then move onto using class time in the final five weeks to work on five weekly mini-projects.

### Skill-building class periods (the first seven weeks)

During these first seven weeks, the class period (lecture + lab) will start with a lecture portion consisting of a brief review of the reading material and a mix of whole-class and small-group activities. This will be followed by time to work on your assignment for that class period. These are individually submitted, but you are welcome to and encouraged to work with those around you. Each assignment will be due by 9 am, the morning of the following class, and will be auto-collected through cocalc.  

### Five mini-projects (the final five weeks)

Each of the five weekly mini-projects will consist of writing code to answer a question or solve a problem and working on these mini-projects will be the main thing you are doing during class time. Each mini-project will leverage the knowledge learned so far, but new concepts will also be introduced as necessary.

### Fortnightly quizzes

Every second week, class will begin with an individual 30-minute in-class quiz. These will emphasize material from the most recent assignments/projects, but will necessarily involve all course content up to that point because of the way that the content builds on itself.

Weeks 8 – 12, Projects.
These classes will focus on mini-projects, one per week. Each project will consist of writing code to answer a question or solve a problem. Each week will bring a new project that will leverage the knowledge learned so far. Some new concepts will be introduced as necessary.

Project		Class time	Due Date
Project 1	Oct 25 & 27	Nov 1, 9 am
Project 2	Nov 1 & 3	Nov 8, 9 am
Project 3	Nov 8 & 15	Nov 17, 9 am (November 10-12 is midterm break)
Project 4	Nov 17 & 22	Nov 24, 9 am
Project 5	Nov 24 & 29	Dec 1, 9 am

Special topics: Dec 1, Dec 6

In class quizzes will take place on:
Sept 22, Oct 6, Oct 20 , Nov 3, Nov 17, and Dec 1.

Marking:

Part A: 65%
	Reading quizzes: 5%
	in-class group activities: 10%
	~12 assignments: 20 %
	5 projects: 30 %

Part B: 35%
	bi-weekly individual in-class quizzes: 35%.

Notes:
- You must pass both part A and part B to pass the course. If you receive a score below 50% on one part, the weighting of the other part will drop to 0, resulting in a failing grade.

- The assignments and quizzes will not be equally weighted as their lengths and complexities will vary.

The marking of your work will be done by a combination of: 1)  automated tools 2) TA-power and 3) peer evaluation. Mistakes will happen. If you think you find an error in the marking or some other blatant injustice, let me know by email, within 1 week of receiving the marked work.

You will be required to evaluate some of the work of your classmates.




COVID SAFETY IN THE CLASSROOM
Masks: Masks are required for all indoor classes, as per the BC Public Health Officer orders. For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space.  For the purposes of this order, the term “masks” refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths.  Masks are a primary tool to make it harder for Covid-19 to find a new host.  You will need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class.  You may be asked to remove your mask briefly for an ID check for an exam, but otherwise, your mask should cover your nose and mouth. Please do not eat in class. You are welcome to step outside for a food/drink break during the lab time. Please note that there are some people who cannot wear a mask. These individuals are equally welcome in our class.
Vaccination: If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.  You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.
Seating in class: To reduce the risk of Covid transmission, please sit in a consistent area of the classroom each day.  This will minimize your contacts and will still allow for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.  Our group work will be done in groups of 3. Please sit with six at each table.
Your personal health
If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). 
●	A daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using this tool: https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en
●	Do not come to class if you have Covid symptoms, have recently tested positive for Covid, or are required to quarantine. You can check this website to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who.
●	Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer.  In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.

	Group work: we will automatically drop the two lowest scores.

Quizzes:  The lowest quiz score will be dropped automatically. If you are sick on the day of a quiz, it would be helpful if you could let me know by email that you will not be attending.

	Clicker questions: do not count for marks

Assignments & projects: Assignments and projects will be digitally collected at the due date/time in whatever state of completion they are in. If you are sick you are expected to catch up on these, please be in touch by email to request an extension.

 Reading quizzes: will close at the due date/time.  If you are sick, please be in touch by email to request an extension.

In general, extensions will be granted for illness without documentation for up to a week’s work. If you find yourself unable to come to class for more time than this, please let me know, or contact Science Advising.

If you do miss class because of illness:
- Consult the class resources on Canvas. We will post lecture slides and readings notes for each class there.
- Come to office hours (they’ll be online so you can join from home).
- ask for help on Piazza

If I (the instructor) am sick:
One of the following will happen:
- If I am well enough to teach, we may have an online session or two. If that happens, you will receive an email telling you how to join the class. This might happen in the usual classroom with the TAs there for regular lab support.
- One of the TAs may lead the class.
- We may cancel a class or two.

Academic integrity and Collaboration:  The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in theAcademic Calendar at
http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

Specifically for PHYS 210: You are encouraged to talk to each other, to us, and to use resources like books and the internet to learn from. Some of our assignments will be group activities, others will be individual. For group activities, we expect you to fully collaborate with the other students in your group. You should ensure you understand the group’s work. For individual assignments and projects, it is ok to ask friends, classmates, or google for ideas on how to attack a problem (what function did you use to generate the random numbers?) , or to help debug something that’s not working as you expect. It is not ok to gather with a friend or two and work through to produce a common version. You need to ensure that the work you turn in reflects your knowledge of the course material.

It is ok to use a line or two of code from something you find on the internet (with attribution). It is not ok to use large blocks of code from anywhere or anybody.

For the quizzes, all work is strictly individual, you must not communicate with anybody else in these activities.

Thoroughly commenting your code to explain how things work, and where ideas came from, especially if you use code constructions you find on the internet or have suggested to you, helps you ensure that you learn from the process, and ensures that (moral) credit is given to the source of the ideas.

What is this course about? What is Computational Physics?

Wikipedia says:
The study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science.

Most realistic physical problems do not have exact analytical solutions!

You may notice as you study physics that a few problems come up over and over again in various forms (eg harmonic oscillator, two-bodies with inverse-square law force). One reason for this is that they are among the few problems for which analytical solutions do exist. Simply adding a third body to a gravitational motion problem, except in a few special cases, makes an analytical solution impossible! Similarly, adding air resistance to a simple kinematics problem can make analytical solution impossible. So when it comes to more complicated physical situations, like predicting the weather, designing aircraft or spacecraft, or calculating molecular interactions, analytical approaches can generally not provide quantitative results.

However, the fundamental physical laws that underlie these problems are usually fairly simple and well understood. Situations like these are ideal for computational approaches, where numerical calculations are used to implement quantitative solutions of simple physical laws. The techniques for numerical computation you will lean in this class can be applied to any subject area you choose: physics, biology, medicine, mathematics, engineering, economics, arts, etc..

To solve problems on computers, you need to tell the computer what to do. Computers in many ways are much simpler than people – they are entirely predictable, they do exactly what they are told, nothing more and nothing less. They are useful though because they can follow their instructions incredibly quickly, processing huge amounts of information and performing numerous calculations in the blink of an eye. All of that power is useless however if you do not formulate your instructions to the computer correctly.

You give the computer instructions in a language. There are many different computer languages, and one can debate the merits of various languages. In this course we will use python. Python is a relatively modern language that has become very popular and has many powerful features. For some history of python, see  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) .

Python is becoming widely used in many scientific (and other!) areas. It is open-source, freely available to run on many platforms, and is powerful in terms of its ability to solve complex tasks with relatively few lines of code. Learning to program python will require you to learn a number of programming concepts that are shared by many programming languages. As with human languages, many programming languages share a common logical structure, but differ in the symbols used, the pronunciation and grammar.  In this class, you will learn the details of python to develop practical problem solving skills, but many of the concepts will be applicable to other programming languages you might encounter later in your career.

There are two main kinds of problems you are likely to face as a scientist: problems where you have measurements from experiments and you would like to compare those to the predictions of a particular theory. For example, imagine you have data describing the positions of the planets in the sky and you want to test if Newton’s law of gravity describes their motion and to what precision. For this type of problem, you solve Newton’s laws on the computer to have it predict the planetary motion, and then you compare this to the measurements. For other problems you might have physical laws which you believe are correct, and you use these to predict the outcome of a certain experiment. For example as a climate scientist you would like to predict the climate over the next 100 years. You need to solve the fluid equations that govern the complex system of air and water and surface (with temperature, humidity, winds, plant cover, human activity, etc) over a long period of time.

Solving such problems requires a number of basic skills:

- the ability to manage files and programs on the computer
- the ability to edit and execute programs
- the ability to read and write data files from within a program
- the ability to manipulate data and perform calculations, both simple and complex, inside the program
- the ability to translate physical laws into computer code that can be used to solve problems and answer questions.
- the ability to visualize the results of calculations.

These are the skills we will learn in python.

Probably all of you have used computers extensively. You may however be unfamiliar with  programming and programming languages. Underneath all of your interactions with computers, be they through web pages, smart-phone apps, office productivity programs or games, the source code is what tells the computer what to do. Learning to program means learning how to write (and debug!) source code. There is no better way of learning programming than by practicing, In this class you will spend most of your time coding.

There are essentially unlimited resources available on the internet to help you learn python. Essentially any question you could think to ask has been asked already. Of course, its not always easy to ask the right question or to find answers that are at the right level for your background. Learning to ask the right question and being able to extract the information you want from documentation are other important skills you will develop this term. Don’t be shy in asking us for help. If you are confused by something, probably other people in the class are too!
