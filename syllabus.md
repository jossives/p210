# PHYS 210 - Introduction to Computational Physics (Fall 2022)
 
**Instructor:** Joss Ives (joss@phas.ubc.ca)

**TAs:**	

**Location:** 	Hebb B112

**Schedule:**  	
| | Section 101/L1A | Section 102/L1B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lecture | Mon/Wed 12:30-13:00 | Mon/Wed 15:30-16:00
| Lab | Mon/Wed 13:00-14:50 | Mon/Wed 16:00-17:50 |

Please attend the section in which you are registered. The division on the timetable between the  Lecture and Lab sections is mostly for bookkeeping. See class format, below.

**Pre-reqs:** One of PHYS 102, PHYS 108, PHYS 118, PHYS 158, PHYS 153, SCIE 001.

**Co-reqs:** One of MATH 152, MATH 221, MATH 223

**Office Hours:**	To be announced

**Textbook:** There is no required textbook. Pre-reading notes will be provided. There are plenty of resources on the internet, but it is not always easy to locate what’s relevant and useful. There is a book available that uses a similar approach and is recommended if you want another source: A Student’s Guide to Python for Physical Modeling. by Kinder and Nelson. There are three versions: “the original”, an “Updated Edition” and the latest “Second Edition.” The newest (2nd edition) is probably the best choice.

**Online Tools:**

- **Cocalc:**  Most of our work will be done on an online computing platform called cocalc. You will need to set up an account at cocalc.com, using an email address. Please see the additional note below. It is possible to use a free account to complete the course, but we recommended improving your overall experience with the palyform by paying the Cocalc course fee (US$14), which allows your work to run on faster servers and will generally provide a better experience.
- **Canvas:** We will make some use of Canvas for course announcements, distributing materials, administering some quizzes, etc.
- **iClickerCloud:** In-class polling.
- **Piazza:** Online discussion forums.

**Your private information and Cocalc:** Cocalc is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site, you are transferred to these servers. UBC cannot guarantee security of your private information on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution regarding the use of your personal information in this context. If you have concerns, you may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy. Please feel free to contact us at UBC (LT.hub@ubc.ca) or CoCalc's support team (help@sagemath.com) if you have any questions about your privacy. If you an email address that we cannot associate with your student profile, please tell us what that address is so that your work can be attributed to you correctly.

## Class format: 

* **Skill-building classes (the first seven weeks):** We will spend the first seven weeks during lecture/lab building up your computation skills in a regular cycle of pre-class activities, in-class group activities and individual lab work. 
* **Mini-projects (the final five weeks):** We will then move onto using class time in the final five weeks to work on five weekly mini-projects.

### Skill-building class periods (the first seven weeks)

During these first seven weeks, the class period (lecture + lab) will start with a lecture portion consisting of a brief review of the reading material and a mix of whole-class and small-group activities. This will be followed by time to work on your assignment for that class period. These are individually submitted, but you are welcome to and encouraged to work with those around you. Each assignment will be due by 9 am the morning of the following class, and will be auto-collected through cocalc.  

### Five mini-projects (the final five+ weeks)

Each of the five weekly mini-projects will consist of writing code to answer a question or solve a problem and working on these mini-projects will be the main thing you are doing during class time. Each mini-project will leverage the knowledge learned so far, but new concepts will also be introduced as necessary. You will typically have one week to complete a mini-project.

### Fortnightly quizzes

Every second week, class will begin with an individual 30-minute in-class quiz. These will emphasize material from the most recent assignments/projects, but will necessarily involve all course content up to that point because of the way that the content builds on itself.

## Grading scheme

Part A: 65%

* Reading quizzes: 5%
* In-class group activities: 10%
* Assignments (~12): 20 %
* Mini-projects (5): 30 %

Part B: 35%

* In-class quizzes (5): 35%.

Notes:

* You must pass both part A and part B to pass the course. If you receive a score below 50% on one part, the weighting of the other part will drop to 0, resulting in a failing grade.
* The assignments and quizzes will not be equally weighted as their lengths and complexities will vary.
* The marking of your work will be done by a combination of: 1)  automated tools 2) TA-power and 3) peer evaluation. Mistakes will happen. If you think you find an error in the marking or some other blatant injustice, let me know by email, within 1 week of receiving the marked work.
* You will be required to evaluate some of the work of your classmates.

Grading scheme flexibility

* Clicker questions will not count for marks
* We will automatically drop your three lowest group activity scores.
* We will drop your lowest quiz score.
* For all other course content, you can request one-week extensions for up to 20% of that type of coursework (mini-projects, assignments, reading quizzes, etc) without needing to provide documentation or needing to apply for academic concessions.
* For academic concessions beyond any of situations described above, appropriate documentation or correspondence from an advisor will be required. Please note that academic concessions may be granted for events falling under the categories of conflicting responsibilities, medical circumstances, or those that require compassionate grounds. Please see the UBC calendar entry on Academic Concession for further details.

If you do miss a class:
* Consult the appropriate resources on Canvas. We will post lecture slides and notes for each class period there.
* Attend office hours, which will always have the option to attend remotely via Zoom. 
* Interact with the teaching team and your peers on Piazza


## COVID safety in the classroom

*This section will be updated before the start of the term to best reflect the current UBC policies.*

## Academic integrity and Collaboration

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is *your* work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or qyuz and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in theAcademic Calendar at
http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

**Specifically for PHYS 210:** You are encouraged to talk to each other, to the teaching team, and to use resources like books and the internet to learn from. Some of our assignments will be group activities, others will be individual. For group activities, we expect you to be a full participant in your group's collaboration and you should ensure you understand the group’s work fully. For individual assignments and projects, it is quite reasonable to ask friends, classmates, or google for ideas on how to attack a problem ("What function did you use to generate the random numbers?") or for help in debuggin something that’s not working as you expect. However, it is not acceptable to gather with a friend or two to work through an assignment to produce a common version. You need to ensure that the work you turn in reflects your knowledge and your application of that knowlege.

* It is ok to use a line or two of code from something you find on the internet (with attribution). It is not ok to use large blocks of code from anywhere or anybody.
* For the quizzes, all work is strictly individual, you must not communicate with anybody else in these activities.
* Thoroughly commenting your code to explain how things work, and where ideas came from, especially if you use code constructions you find on the internet or have suggested to you, helps you ensure that you learn from the process, and ensures that (moral) credit is given to the source of the ideas.

## University support & resources

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available: https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success
